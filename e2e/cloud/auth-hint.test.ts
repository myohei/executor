// Cloud-specific: the auth-hint lifecycle that lets the app paint the REAL
// authenticated shell with no full-page skeleton, ever. The sealed session is
// HttpOnly, so the SPA can't derive identity from it — instead the SSR gate
// verifies the session per document request, renders the shell from that
// verified identity, and MINTS the non-HttpOnly hint cookie
// (executor-auth-hint) when the browser doesn't hold a current one. From
// then on AuthProvider keeps the hint fresh on every confirmed /account/me
// and logout takes it away with the session.
