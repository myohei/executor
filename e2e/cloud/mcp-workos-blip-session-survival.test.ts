// Cloud: an MCP session's relationship to WorkOS after the membership mirror.
//
// Membership is authorized from the local mirror on every /mcp request
// (`auth/organization.ts`); WorkOS is a write target and an event source, not
// a per-request read. Two contracts follow, pinned here at the real upstream
// (faults armed on the WorkOS emulator's membership endpoint — the same
// emulator the product's real WorkOS SDK talks to; no product code or stubs
// touched):
//
// 1. A WorkOS OUTAGE is INVISIBLE to a live session. Before the mirror, a
//    5xx from the membership lookup had to be classified as transient (a
//    retryable 503 that left the session alive) so a blip could not
//    mass-condemn every session of a shared-API-key org. Now the request never
//    asks WorkOS at all: a request issued during the outage is a plain 200,
//    and the SAME session id keeps serving afterwards. The fault is armed on
//    the exact endpoint the old check hit, so an unnoticed regression back to
//    a per-request WorkOS read would fail this as a 503 (or worse, a 403).
//
// 2. A REVOKED membership still fails CLOSED. The mirror is not a cache with a
//    TTL: a removal made through the product writes the mirror in the same
//    request, so the removed member's next /mcp request is a Forbidden, the
//    session is condemned, and the id is dead. Retrying cannot help.
