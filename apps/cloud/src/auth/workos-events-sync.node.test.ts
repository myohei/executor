// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The membership mirror's RECONCILER (`workos-events-sync.ts`) and the
// webhook that pokes it (`workos-webhook.ts`), against the real PGlite
// Postgres every cloud unit test runs on (scripts/test-globalsetup.ts).
// WorkOS is a fake `WorkOSClient` for the Events API (the emulator has no
// events route); the signature check runs the REAL client's verifier over a
// locally computed HMAC, because that check is the webhook's only
// authentication.
//
// What this pins:
//   - every followed event type lands in the mirror: user created/updated/
//     deleted, membership created/updated/deleted, organization renamed
//   - an older event never regresses a newer row (`stale`) — an older
//     organization rename included — a replayed delete is `absent`, and
//     `organization.deleted` MARKS the org deleted (refusing every membership
//     authorization) without purging anything;
//     replayed, or after cloud's own flow marked it first, it is `absent`
//   - `organization.deleted` for an org the mirror has never seen MINTS a
//     tombstone row, so a login that fetched a membership of it before the
//     deletion cannot mint the org or the membership afterwards
//   - a delete TOMBSTONES its row as of the event's `createdAt`, so an older
//     payload replayed after it is `stale` and the row stays inactive — even
//     when the delete arrives before the mirror has ever seen the membership
//     (the reconciler ahead of the backfill): the tombstone is minted, with
//     its organization, so the backfill cannot insert the row live
//   - a membership created or updated for a member the mirror holds no
//     profile for reads the profile from WorkOS (one `getUser`, only then),
//     so a pre-boundary user who joins a scanned org is searchable by name
//     and email; a member WorkOS no longer has is mirrored bare, and a
//     transient failure fails the run
//   - a membership for an organization the mirror has never seen mirrors
//     the org first (one WorkOS read), so the foreign key holds; one whose
//     org WorkOS no longer has marks the org deleted instead (minting the
//     tombstone) and the cursor still advances, while a transient WorkOS
//     failure still fails the run
//   - `organization.updated` never inserts an org the mirror does not hold
//   - a run with no cursor reads from the backfill's replay boundary, and
//     with no boundary either reads nothing (the backfill has not run)
//   - a run pages from the persisted cursor, commits after every page, and
//     STOPS when another run moves the cursor under it — with NOTHING from
//     the contended page written (a lagging run cannot resurrect a
//     membership the leading run already deleted)
//   - a run that reads the stream to its end records the drain as of its
//     start (the authorization path's caught-up check); a run that read
//     nothing, or yielded the stream, records none
//   - the webhook accepts only a genuinely signed delivery, never applies
//     it, and refuses everything when no signing secret is configured
