// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The membership mirror's FEEDERS, end to end through the code that runs in
// production, against the real PGlite Postgres every cloud unit test runs on
// (scripts/test-globalsetup.ts). WorkOS is a fake `WorkOSClient` (the
// emulator has no list-users / events routes); the mirror, the user store,
// and the directory read are the live layers over `DbService.Live`.
//
// What this pins:
//   - the login callback records the signed-in user and EVERY membership
//     WorkOS lists (active and pending), with the org row minted so the FK
//     holds — from the one membership list it already fetches
//   - the callback picks the landing org from that same list: a returnTo
//     slug or last-org cookie lands only in an ACTIVE membership, an unknown
//     or pending one falls through
//   - `inviteMember` mirrors the PENDING membership WorkOS created for the
//     invitee (found by email among the org's pending memberships), so the
//     member list shows the invite and can revoke it
//   - `removeMember` tombstones the mirror row after the WorkOS delete,
//     stamped with the membership's last WorkOS state (never a local clock),
//     so a replay of the membership as it was before the delete cannot
//     restore it while a replacement WorkOS created meanwhile is accepted
//   - `updateMemberRole` writes the role WorkOS returned
//   - deleting an org marks it deleted locally FIRST, so every member's
//     session is refused at once even when the billing cancel, the WorkOS
//     delete, or the local purge fails afterwards; billing is cancelled
//     BEFORE the WorkOS delete, so a failed cancel leaves the WorkOS org
//     intact and the retry finishes the deletion; a retry after WorkOS
//     already deleted the org still runs the purge — even while the mirror
//     is not ready, when WorkOS can no longer vouch for the admin; a marked
//     org leaves the switcher
//   - authorization scans an organization the backfill never covered (its
//     `backfilled_at` is missing) from WorkOS before reading its mirror,
//     once, so a member the mirror never recorded is admitted; an
//     organization the mirror does not hold at all is resolved from WorkOS
//     for a caller WorkOS confirms as its member, and minted for nobody else
//   - the seat gate trusts the mirror's count only for an organization whose
//     membership list was scanned from WorkOS in full: an unmarked one is
//     scanned first (once), so a partial mirror never admits an invite past
//     the plan limit
//   - the seat reporter scans an unmarked organization before counting and
//     never re-scans a marked one
//   - the backfill mirrors every org's members and counts what it wrote,
//     writes nothing on a dry run, converges on a re-run, tombstones a
//     membership WorkOS no longer lists — but never one written after its
//     listing was taken — marks each org backfilled as of its listing, and
//     records the events replay boundary BEFORE its first listing and only
//     ONCE: a run that fails part-way keeps the marks of the orgs it
//     finished and the boundary it recorded, and its retry (like any later
//     run) keeps that first boundary — so a user deleted between the failed
//     attempt and the retry is still inside the events replay, and the
//     reconciler clears their profile
//   - two scans of one org that overlap cannot resurrect a membership: a scan
//     that listed it, stalled, and resumed after a later listing (which no
//     longer had it) was applied is refused whole
//   - a login whose membership list was fetched BEFORE the org was purged and
//     written after cannot re-mint the org or its membership, one fetched
//     before a rename cannot revert the rename, and one fetched before a
//     revocation the backfill has since scanned cannot reinstate the
//     membership
