// Resolution — local mirror with lazy WorkOS fallback.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// We keep a minimal local mirror of organizations so domain tables can
// foreign-key against them and so we don't hit WorkOS on every request.
// But the mirror can drift: a user's session can reference an org that was
// created outside this app (or before the mirror existed). Rather than
// proactively mirroring on every login — which was the source of the messy
// callback flow we just untangled — we mirror lazily the first time an
// unknown org is read. All other callers just do `getOrganization` and get
// a self-healing lookup for free.
//
// URL slugs are OURS (WorkOS orgs have none) and are minted at the moment a
// row is inserted — `upsertOrganization` is the single mint point, so the
// mirror-on-first-read below produces a slugged, routable org without any
// read-path healing.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Deletion mark — the local step that revokes an organization.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Membership is authorized from the local mirror (below), so deleting the
// WorkOS organization revokes nothing here by itself: the local membership
// rows keep authorizing sessions until the local purge removes them, and a
// purge that fails leaves them live. This mark is what revokes access, and it
// is the FIRST step of cloud's deletion flow (`auth/handlers.ts`
// deleteOrganization) — before the WorkOS delete and the purge, both of which
// can fail — and what the `organization.deleted` event applies
// (`workos-events-sync.ts`) when the org was deleted in the WorkOS dashboard
// instead. Membership rows are left as they are; the mark alone refuses them.
// Idempotent: a retry keeps the first mark. An org the mirror does not hold
// is not marked (nothing to revoke), and `false` says so.

export const markOrganizationDeleted = (organizationId: string) =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const users = yield* UserStoreService;
    const at = new Date(yield* Clock.currentTimeMillis);
    const marked = yield* users.use("markOrganizationDeleted", (s) =>

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Authorization — membership check against the local membership mirror.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The sealed session cookie carries an organizationId that WorkOS signed at
// login / refresh time. WorkOS does NOT invalidate existing sessions when a
// membership is revoked, and `session.authenticate()` validates the JWT
// locally without hitting the API — so a removed user would keep full access
// until their access token naturally expired (~10 min) if the session were
// trusted on its own.
//
// To close that gap, membership is verified on every protected request
// against the LOCAL mirror of WorkOS memberships (`memberships` join
// `accounts`, read through the shared `MemberDirectory`) — never against
// WorkOS itself, and unconditionally: there is no readiness gate and no
// per-request WorkOS fallback. The mirror is not a cache with a TTL; it is a
// replica whose freshness is defined by its feeders:
//   - login (`auth/handlers.ts` callback): the user and every membership WorkOS
//     lists for them, from the list the callback already fetches;
//   - write-through: every membership change Executor makes (create org,
//     invite, accept, remove, change role) lands in the mirror in the same
//     request, so a revocation through Executor is denied on the NEXT request;
//   - the WorkOS Events API reconciler (`workos-events-sync.ts`, every minute
//     by cron plus a signed webhook poke): changes made in the WorkOS
//     dashboard land within seconds.
// The membership row must be `active`: a pending invitee is not a member, and a
// deactivated member keeps their row but not their access. And the
// organization must not be marked deleted (`organizations.deleted_at`): cloud's
// deletion flow (`auth/handlers.ts` deleteOrganization) sets that mark FIRST,
// before the WorkOS delete and the local purge, so an org whose deletion did
// not finish refuses every session at once — its membership rows are still
// there, live, until the purge removes them, and must not authorize anyone.
//
// The one-off backfill is complete and permanent, and an organization that
// predates it is covered on demand (below), so there is nothing left for a
// per-request readiness check to gate. What can still go wrong is the events
// reconciler falling behind — a member revoked in the WorkOS dashboard would
// keep a stale active row until it catches up. That is now an OPERATIONAL
// concern, not a request-path fallback: the reconciler itself
// (`workos-events-runner.ts`) checks its own drain lag after every run and
// raises a Sentry error when it has stalled, so it is fixed by paging someone,
// not by asking WorkOS on every request. The deploy gate
// (`scripts/ensure-workos-mirror-ready.ts`) separately refuses to ship a build
// that trusts the mirror while it is unready, using the same rule
// (`mirror-readiness-store.ts`).
//
// Completeness is PER ORGANIZATION. An organization whose row was minted
// after the backfill ran — lazily by a request (`resolveOrganization`), or by
// a first login — carries no `backfilled_at`, and the mirror holds only the
// memberships login and write-through happened to record for it: a member
// who has not signed in since would be refused on a row that was never
// written. So the org row is read FIRST, and an unmarked live organization is
// scanned from WorkOS (`ensureOrganizationBackfilled`: one membership listing
// plus one `getUser` per member, then the mark) BEFORE its mirror is read —
// the same on-demand scan the seat gates run. One-time per organization: the
// scan marks the row, and this branch is never taken for it again. An
// organization the mirror does not hold at all — one that predates the
// mirror and that nobody has signed in to since (a CLI or MCP token names it,
// and the JWT path has no login feeder), or one created in the WorkOS
// dashboard — is reachable by neither the backfill (which lists the mirror's
// organizations) nor the reconciler (which starts at the replay boundary), so
// it is resolved on demand HERE: WorkOS is asked for the caller's own
// membership in it first (`getUserOrgMembership`, a read scoped to this
// caller — never a listing of the org), and only a member's answer mints the
// row (`resolveOrganization`) and scans it as above. A non-member mints
// nothing: a signed-in caller cannot create the row of an arbitrary WorkOS
// organization by naming its id. An organization marked deleted is never
// scanned: WorkOS no longer has it, and its rows are the purge's to remove,
// not a listing's to refresh.
//
// Returns the resolved organization if the user currently holds an *active*
// membership in it, otherwise null. Callers should treat null as "no access"
// and route accordingly (onboarding page / 403).
//
// The ONE caller that may see a marked org is the deletion flow itself
// (`deleted: "allow"`): an admin whose deletion failed after the mark must be
// able to send it again to finish the purge, and their membership row is
