// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Cloud admin users API — the shared, provider-neutral `AdminUsersHandlers`
// backed by a WorkOS-authorized platform view, mounted at `/api/admin/users*`.
//
// TWO credentials reach this plane, and they are the two an operator actually
// has:
//   1. an ORG-SCOPED api key -> `PlatformAuth`. The key IS the authority: WorkOS
//      validated it and reported which org owns it, and there is no member
//      behind it to check membership for. This is the machine credential
//      (a customer's backend calling us).
//   2. an admin SESSION member -> the console. Requires the caller's mirrored
//      membership (the shared `MemberDirectory` over the local membership
//      mirror) to carry the `admin` role AND `active` status, matching the
//      strictest existing cloud guard (`auth/handlers.ts`'s org-delete check) —
//      a pending admin invite is not an admin.
// A plain member session, or a USER-scoped api key, is refused: both name one
// acting member, and this plane deliberately serves the whole tenant.
//
// The executor is built by `makePlatformExecutor` — `{ tenant, subject:
// undefined, platformView: true }` — so the reads are tenant-wide and read-only
// by storage policy, and no `subject` row is minted for the caller.
//
// Cross-tenant isolation is structural, not a check in this file: the tenant is
// taken from the resolved credential (the key's own org, or the session's
// authorized org), never from client input, and `reach: "tenant"` still filters
// every query by that tenant.
